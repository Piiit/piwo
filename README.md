# pwPHPwiki

A simple PHP wiki to test my wiki-parser...
It supports only a singleuser wiki cms with some main file management features.
Mainly implemented to test the lexer and parser.

This project is still beta... with a lot of fast and dirty test codings... 

...just for fun!!!
:)

Just download this source and the pwPHPtools to *Enjoy!!!*


ps. Currently most content is in german. Click on "Show Source" to see what is possible with this wiki parser :) It doesn't support multiple user logins, so at this stage it's just a read-only presentation...

Please note: I am working on this version 2 of my project, so its possible that things do not work always at all time. Many things have changed, including design patterns, that are object oriented from now onwards!
