## Introduction
A simple PHP wiki to test my wiki-parser...
It supports only a singleuser wiki cms with some main file management features.
Mainly implemented to test the lexer and parser.

This project is still beta... with a lot of fast and dirty test codings... 

...just for fun!!!

You can have a look at it: [http://www.piwo.host-ed.me/?mode=cleared&id=index www.piwo.host-ed.me]. (Details of it's [http://www.piwo.host-ed.me/?id=dokumentation:textgestaltung capabilities]) *Enjoy!!!*


ps. Currently all content and ui-labels are in german. Click on _"Quelltext anzeigen"_ if you want to see the wiki-sourcecode of the displayed page. It doesn't support multiple user logins, so at this stage it's just a read-only presentation...

Please note: I am working on version 2, the presentation is about the first version. Many things have changed, including design patterns, that are object oriented from now onwards!
